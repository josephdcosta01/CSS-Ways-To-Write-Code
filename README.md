# CSS-Ways-To-Write-Code

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML.

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section.
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file.
